These are the design files for my new 65% keyboard PCB, I use Eagle and AutoCAD for designing. 
A few things  before I proceed; as apparent it's in a very crude state currently and needs a lot of tinkering, since this is my fisrt design, I ran into quite a few problems;
1. The board became a tad too crowded, so I made a bit of space on the left for all the electronics to rest, this might make trouble for routing later, but I'm not sure.
2. Since I'll be hand soldering all of the components myself, I went for larger, through hole ones, instead of the usual SMD business. Fitting everything on the board has been a rather nerve wracking affair, but let me know what you think. 
3. Connecting the controller to the matrix. Now this is where I have faltered. Connecting the rows to the controller was straightforward enough, albeit when it comes to connecting columns, the airwire ends up either one key switch down from where I intended (the top pin of the top switch) or on the bottom switch. I figured that the way I had routed the column initially, but on redoing it multiple times, the problem still persists, so I'm uncerrtain how to proceed.
